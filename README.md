# 📊 CMIE Data Imputation Project

🔍 **Understanding Missing Data in Large-Scale Surveys**  
This project explores the impact of **missing data** in the **CMIE (Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy) Consumer Pyramids dataset**, applying **statistical, machine learning, and deep learning imputation methods** to recover missing values and improve predictive modeling.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The **CMIE Consumer Pyramids dataset** is a structured longitudinal survey covering **~240,000 households across India** over multiple waves. It includes diverse sociodemographic variables such as **income, consumption, and household demographics**.

Our goal is to:
- **Simulate missingness** (MCAR, MAR, MNAR) in **spatial and temporal dimensions**.
- **Apply different imputation techniques** (statistical, ML, deep learning).
- **Evaluate imputation quality** using RMSE (for continuous) & accuracy (for categorical).
- **Analyze economic impact** of missing data on policy decisions.

## 🛠 Methods

| 📌 Approach  | 🔬 Techniques |
|-------------|----------------------------------|
| **Baseline** | Mean/Mode |
| **Statistical** | MICE |
| **ML-Based** | MissForest, k-NN |
| **Deep Learning** | GAIN (GAN-based), MIDAS/VAE (Autoencoders), DSAN (Attention-based) |

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics
- **Imputation Performance**: RMSE (continuous variables) & accuracy (categorical variables).
- **Downstream Task Impact**: Effect on predictive models (poverty classification, health trends).
- **Economic Cost Mapping**: Assess impact of imputation errors on policy decisions.

## 🔮 Future Work
Integrate Bayesian approaches for uncertainty quantification.
Extend analysis to other large-scale survey datasets.
Investigate causal impact of imputation errors on policy simulations.
